                <p class="card-text">
                    Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems. Developed more than 3,000 years ago in India, 
                    it's based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit.

                    when your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe. A disruption of this harmony can lead to poor 
                    health and sickness.
